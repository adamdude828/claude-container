echo "=== Testing Fixed Task Step 3: Improved Task Command ==="
echo
echo "CHANGES MADE:"
echo "1. Task command now prompts for branch name AND task description separately"
echo "2. Branch is created and pushed immediately (no PR yet)"
echo "3. PR is created automatically AFTER task completion by the daemon"
echo "4. Daemon checks for existing PRs to avoid duplicates"
echo

echo "IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:"
echo "✓ Updated 'claude-container task start' to:"
echo "  - Prompt for branch name (not auto-generated)"
echo "  - Prompt for task description"
echo "  - Create and push branch without PR"
echo "  - Pass metadata to daemon for PR creation later"
echo
echo "✓ Updated daemon to:"
echo "  - Accept metadata with task submissions"
echo "  - Skip PR creation for 'feature_task' type during submission"
echo "  - Create PR after task completion for feature tasks"
echo "  - Check for existing PRs before creating new ones"
echo
echo "✓ Updated GitHubIntegration class with:"
echo "  - get_pr_for_branch() method"
echo "  - Enhanced create_pull_request() with draft parameter"
echo

echo "WORKFLOW:"
echo "1. User runs: claude-container task start"
echo "2. Enters branch name: feature/fix-auth-bug"
echo "3. Enters task description: Fix authentication bug in login module"
echo "4. Branch is created and pushed (empty)"
echo "5. Claude task starts with instructions to:"
echo "   - Check/switch to branch"
echo "   - Complete the task"
echo "   - Commit changes"
echo "6. After task completion, daemon automatically:"
echo "   - Checks if PR exists for branch"
echo "   - Creates PR if none exists"
echo "   - Includes task description and details in PR"
echo

echo "BENEFITS:"
echo "✓ No error creating PR on empty branch"
echo "✓ PR contains actual commits from the task"
echo "✓ User controls branch naming"
echo "✓ Automatic PR creation after work is done"
echo "✓ Prevents duplicate PRs"

echo "=== Implementation Complete ===
