echo "3. Creates a branch and PR on the host level"
echo "4. Starts an async Claude task with instructions"

echo "  claude-container task start [--branch BRANCH_NAME]"
echo
echo "Features:"
echo "- Prompts for task description"
echo "- Auto-generates branch name if not provided"
echo "- Creates feature branch and draft PR"
echo "- Starts Claude with --dangerously-skip-permissions flag"

echo "  e. Commit to the branch when done"
echo

echo "Example usage:"
echo "$ claude-container task start"

echo "3. Create a draft PR with the task description"
echo "4. Start Claude with the task prompt"
